Data Analysis: Movie Quality Over the Years
Overview This project focuses on analyzing movie ratings over time to uncover trends, patterns, and insights into the evolution of movie ratings on the IMDb platform. The dataset used contains information on IMDb ratings for movies spanning several decades. Throughout our analysis, we asked 3 questions: • Is there an overall increase in volume of movies over time? • Is the overall quality of movies decreasing over time? • Is there an increase in Gross Revenue over time? Conclusively, our overarching question is; do we have enough evidence to suggest that the volume of movies released has increased over the years due to the pursuit of profit, potentially leading to a sacrifice in the overall quality of movies?

The dataset used in this project consists of the following fields: • Movie Title: The title of the movie • Release Year: The year the movie was released. • Rating: The average rating given to the movie. • Gross: The revenue generated per movie. • Average Gross: The revenue generated per year. Methodology Data Collection: Gather IMDb movie ratings data from reliable sources or APIs. Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and perform necessary transformations. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize data to understand distributions, correlations, and outliers. Trend Analysis: Use time-series analysis techniques to identify trends in movie ratings.
